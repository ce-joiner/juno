## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode
- Functional components with hooks
- Zustand for state management

## Architecture
- Feature-based folder structure
- Screens in src/screens/{feature}

## Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., PlannerDayScreen.tsx)
- Files: kebab-case for utilities (e.g., date-utils.ts)
- Stores: use{Feature}Store (e.g., usePlannerStore.ts)
